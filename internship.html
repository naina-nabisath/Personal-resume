        <h1 id="java">Java Full Stact</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                I completed my Java Full Stack Development training at Kommpetenzen Technology, where I gained hands-on
                experience in building end-to-end web applications. The program covered both frontend and backend
                technologies, helping me understand the complete software development lifecycle.

                On the frontend, I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern UI practices to design responsive and
                user-friendly interfaces. On the backend, I developed applications using Core Java, Advanced Java, JDBC,
                Servlets, JSP, and Spring Boot, focusing on clean architecture and efficient data handling.

                I also gained experience with database management using MySQL, including writing queries, designing
                schemas, and integrating databases with Java applications. As part of the course, I worked on real-time
                projects, which strengthened my problem-solving skills, debugging abilities, and understanding of full
                stack integration.

                This training helped me build a strong foundation in Java Full Stack Development, preparing me to
                develop scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications.

        <h1 id="prompt">Prompt Engineer</h1>
        <p>
            I have experience working as a Prompt Engineer, where I focused on designing, testing, and optimizing
            prompts to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs from large language models. My role
            involved understanding user intent and translating it into well-structured prompts to improve response
            quality and consistency.

            I worked on creating prompts for various use cases such as content generation, question answering,
            summarization, and task automation. I also analyzed model behavior, refined prompt patterns, and applied
            techniques like role prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction tuning to achieve better results.

            Through this experience, I developed strong skills in logical thinking, clarity of instructions,
            experimentation, and iterative improvement, ensuring that AI outputs aligned with project requirements and
            user expectations.

        <h1 id="mern">MERN Stack</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing MERN Stack Development and have successfully completed HTML as part of my learning
            journey. Through HTML, I have learned to structure web pages using semantic elements, create forms, tables,
            and build well-organized, accessible layouts.
